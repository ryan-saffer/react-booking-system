### Ingredients
* Bicarbonate soda X 4  15ml FLAT spoons
* Citric acid X 2 15ml  FLAT spoons
* Scent (if requested) X 2 drops 
* Colour dye X 2-4 drops (depending on colour)
* Sunflower oil X1  15ml of 
* Bath bomb molds

### Recipe
1. Add bicarbonate soda to bowl and mix with fingers
> Fizz Tip: Mixing with fingers is BEST as it gets lumps out and it keeps the activity sensory - if any children and eczema or have cuts, they can mix with a popsicle stick
2. Add citric acid to the bowls, keeping mixing
3. Add colour and mix
> Fizz Tip: adding colour here keeps the kids engaged, especially younger ones
4. Add oil and mix, getting right to bottom and making sure no white in their bowls
5. Add scent (if requested) and mix
6. Add glitter (if requested) and mix
> Fizz Tip: can be added at the end on top of bath bombs! Or in the middle for a glitter bomb effect
7. Each child receives one bath bomb container and presses all their mixture into their container as hard as they can with thumbs and heel of hands
> Fizz Tip: explain that it's like a sandcastle, the more they press down the better it will be
8. Put RIGHT SIDE UP, still in container into bags after facilitator checks they are all pressed down

### Fizz Tipz and Trickz
* Add more oil if too dry (bath bombs should be sticking together as though it was a cake mixture)
* More bicarb and citric if too wet - wet mixtures will not set
* Bathbombs can be any theme and any colour e.g. spider man bombs, frozen bathbombs etc
* If adding an animal/bug - that goes in first and the mixture goes on top - like it's being hidden 
* Blue is a heavy colour - add less drops of blue compared to lighter colors like yellow
* Mixing of colours does not work e.g., pink and blue to make purple. If purple is a colour a child wants, lip pigment can be used: smaller than a pinky finger nail amount

* Scent (if requested) x2 shakes
* Sunflower oil x1 15ml spoon
* Pigment LIP powder x1/2 1ml spoon (added to the microwavable jug, not individually to bowls)
* Glitter (if requested)
* Popsicle sticks x1 per child
* Lip balm containers (one per child)

> Fizz Tip: Make this creationfirst if the party/program has no other creations that require melting. If party/program has soap and lip balm as the creations, MAKE SOAP FIRST 

### Recipe
1. Add beeswax into bowls
2. Add cocobutter OR coconut oil into bowls
> Fizz Tip: If using the circular disc pieces of cocobutter, get kids to break into smaller pieces/ If using coconut oil, pass the jar around and get the kids to scoop it out of the jar themselves, using a posivle stick to assist.
3. Add sunflower into bowls and mix
4. Add scent if requested 
5. Add glitter if requested
6. Combine all childrens mixtures into a microwavable jug
> Fizz Tip: this can be the most boring part/tricky especially for younger kids. Have two jugs/multiple jugs going and break into teams to see who can combine ingredients into one jug first as a race
> Fizz Tip: While kids are combining ingredients, hand out lip balm containers and make sure they are at arms length away from kids on table with lids off
7. Microwave for 60 seconds and check mixture - microwave until no solid ingredients are visible 
8. Add pigment in front of kids, mix and then pour carefully in front of kids while they begin next creation
9. Wait for lip balms to set before putting on lids

### Fizz Tipz and Trickz
* Lip balm can be any theme or colour (that is in line with what pigments there are in store). Frozen lipbalm, galaxy lip balm, barbie lip balm etc
* If doing two colours for a double pour, have separate jugs with separate pigment colour e.g. one jug blue and one jug pink

> Fizz Tip: This recipe is for any soap that involves more than one colour in the same mold

### Ingredients
* Vegetable Glycerin x 2-4 cubes (cut to size - see photo)
* Scent (if requested)
* Colour dye 
* Biodegradable glitter (if asked for)
* Soap molds
* Popcicle sticks

> Fizz Tip: Glycerin cubes should be SMALL cubes (see photo) so as not to OVER make soaps. Depending on how LARGE or SMALL the molds are, depends on how many cubes go into a childs bowl (see photos).

### Recipe
1. Add between 2-4 cubes of glycerin to bowls 
> Fizz Tip: This is often the most boring part while the cubes are being passed around - have two buckets going and encourage the kids to smell and feel the cubes to describe what it's like - this will keep them engaged
2. Add scent (if requested) and mix 
> Fizz tip: Great time to play guess the scent!
3. Add colours - alternating between each bowl. E.g. pink, blue, pink, blue etc. and mix
> Fizz Tip: Keep colour dye to one drop per child (as every child is getting colour dye and too much will stain) - up to four colours can be done for rainbow soap
4. Add biodegradable glitter (if requested) 
> Fizz Tip: Playing 'Shake it Off' while completing this step is always punny (shaking glitter to shake it off) and keeps kids engaged 
5. Combine all cubes into a microwavable jug. Keep the colours separate e.g. PINK in one jug and BLUE in another.
> Fizz Tip: Another little boring step that can be hyped with teams/a race - 'whichever team finishes first can wash hands first' or 'your challenge is to get all cubes into this jug by the end of this song'
6. Melt in microwave for 1 minute intervals, until smooth
7. Pour first colour in front of kids and allow to mostly set 
8. Pour second colour on top of first in front of kids
9. Allow to set and hand out at end of party - CLARIFY NOT LOLLY IT'S SOAP

### Fizz Tipz and Trickz
* Soap can be any theme or colour arrangement -. Frozen soap, galaxy soap, superman soap etc.
* Pour soap quicker and don't let layers set in between for as long so that colours blend into each other and create a "marble effect". 

**_Left to right_**
* Smallest size soap molds = 2 cubes but kids take TWO soaps home
* Medium size soap molds = 2 cubes and kids take ONE soap home
* Larger size soap molds = 4 cubes and kids take ONE soap home

### Ingredients
* Bath crystals x3 FLAT 15ml spoons (per layer)
* Citric Acid x 2 FLAT 15ml spoons (middle layer only)
* Colour dye x2-4 drops depending on colour
* Scent (if requested) x2 shakes
* Glitter - biodegradable only (if requested and final layer only
* Containers and lids x1 per child

### Recipe
**_LAYER ONE_**
> Fizz Tip: Start with the lightest colour
1. Add the bath crystals to bowl
2. Add first colour and mix well
3. Pour into container
> Fizz Tip: make sure all colour and ingredients comes out of the bowl ready for next layer

**_LAYER TWO_**
> Fizz tip: second lightest colour 
1. Add the bath crystals to the bowl
> Fizz Tip: clarify to kids, especially young ones, that they are adding to BOWL not container
2. Add colour and mix 
3. Add citric acid
4. Mix well and pour into container.
> Fizz Tip: make sure all colour and ingredients comes out of the bowl ready for next layer

**_LAYER THREE_**
> Fizz tip: darkest colour on top
1. Add the bath crystals to bowl
> Fizz Tip: clarify to kids, especially young ones, that they are adding to BOWL not container
2. Add scent/glitter if requested
3. Add the colour and mix well
4. Pour into container.

### Fizz Tipz and Trickz
* The blue is a heavy colour - 1-2 drops will ensure kids don't end up looking like a smurf. Yellow is very light - might need 3-4 drops to make sure it shows through
* If Blue is accidentally added with citric acid (middle layer) and it turns green, add x1 1ml of bicarb and it will turn back to blue
* Can be made without critic acid for kids with eczema.
* Generally, the best colours for rainbow bath crystals are yellow, pink/red and blue - mixing of colours does not work e.g., pink and blue to make purple. If purple is a colour the birthday child wants, lip pigment can be used: smaller than a pinky finger nail amount
* We can do any theme of bath crystals and there can be repeat colours on layers. Lava bath crystals, Encanto bath crystals, peter pan bath crystals etc

> Fizz Tip: Fizz is about encouraging children to be hands on so don't discourage them from touching their slime - instead tell the children what consistency the slime should be BEFORE they touch it
4. Split slime into sections and flatten like pancakes
> Fizz Tip: the younger the kids are, the less sections. For Example 3-5 year olds only separate into two sections, if 5-7 split into 3 sections and 7 + split into four sections
5. Each slime section has a different colour
> Fizz Tip: so that the kids don't get the colour all over their hands, put x2 drops of colour into middle of slime pancake then fold the colour into the slime
6. LAYER colours in container

### Fizz Tipz and Trickz
* Let kids know that the colours when mixed will probably go a shade of green/brown as that's what is COOL about colour theory - so really encourage them to layer their slime
* Add more sodium bicarbonate if sticky, more activator if runny. Mix and knead as fast as possible once out of the bowl.
* Add more glue if overactivated

> Fizz Tip: We can make ANY themed slime. Hulk slime, fairy slime, Watermelon slime. The key ingredient to making a specific slime that isn't listed on our website is putting a creative hat on and asking the child 'what would that look like?'

### Ingredients
* Clear Glue (can also use white) x4 15ml BIG spoons
* Sodium Bicarbonate x1 15ml FLAT spoon 
* Green colouring x2 drops
* Glitter silver, black or green
* Activator x1 15ml spoon
* Googly eyes x2 per child
* Popsicle stick x1 per child
* Containers and lids

### Recipe
1. Add the glue to bowls and mix - lots of bubbles
2. Add the sodium bicarbonate to bowls and mix
3. Add colour
4. Add glitter
5. Activate and remove all slime from bowls for children to play with. (See activator instructions at the top of the page)
> Fizz Tip: Fizz is about encouraging children to be hands on so don't discourage them from touching their slime - instead tell the children what consistency the slime should be BEFORE they touch it
6. Add googly eyes and make slime into a monster!!
7. Put into slime containers

### Fizz Tipz and Trickz
* Monster slime is advertised as green but if children are pushing for different colours, we can
* Add more sodium bicarbonate if sticky, more activator if runny. Mix and knead as fast as possible once out of the bowl.
* Add more glue if overactivated
* Kids can do their own glitter if old enough to do so - no more glitter than there is glue

const tieDye = {
    name: 'Tie Dye',
    markdown: `
> Fizz Tip: This creation MUST have aprons and gloves worn by children UNLESS there is parental/guardian permission to not. Upon entry, it does well to flag with each parent, what is involved and what MIGHT happen if tie dye gets on clothes. None of this is to come into contact with food - this is to be prepared outside of the kitchen. Aprons on chairs as kids come into the venue to save time putting them on later.
### Ingredients
* Tie Dye item to be PRE SOAKED in _Soda Ash - see instructions below_
* Dye
* Gloves
* Rubber bands x minimum of 4 per child
* Aprons 
* Trays x1 per child
* Zip lock bags

### Preparation
**Preparing the Tie Dye item**
1. In a hand washing basin or large tub fill with the following ratio **1 cup of soda ash for every 4 liters of warm water.**
2. Soak the items, making sure they are completely wet. 
3. Rince the items out thoroughly making sure there is as little water still in the item as possible. 
4. Place each item in a separate tub ready to go to each child

**Preparing the Tie Dye**
1. You should prepare three bottles per colour - PINK, YELLOW AND BLUE- each of these makes another colour if mixed together. Add 2.5ml of pigment to each bottle. It is best to pre-make the dye fresh each week. 

### Running the Tie Dye Party
1. Hand out one tie dye item to each child in the tray 
2. In your excited and enthusiastic Fizz Kidz voice, explain that there are three ways we can make our tie Dye creations and they have names! 
* Scrunchy: Demonstrate how you scrunch your tie dye item up and then tie rubber bands around it.
* Rolley: Demonstrate how you roll your item up like a long roll and then tie rubber bands all the way down. This will create line effects.
* Swirley: Demonstrate how to place one finger in the middle of your tie dye item, swirl the item around it, and then add rubber hands tightly. 
3. Dye time - explain the dye process first then hand out bottles
> Fizz Tip: this step does require kids to be paying attention please make sure this happens. 'Cool thing about tie dye is it never comes off, this is your design forever! Bad thing about tie dye is it never comes off…so make sure these bottles are handled with care so as not to have a spill and get onto your clothes!!'
4. All white parts of the item to have colour, little squirts at a time. A little goes a long way. Making sure ANY spills are cleaned up with paper towel immediately and the items stay in the tray
5. Facilitators to put items into zip lock bags and then into creation bags when kids are finishing up
> Fizz Tip: Watch out for the kids who say they are still going but it's just a pool of Shrek swamp colour, time to finish
6. Gloves off and into tray

### Fizz Tipz and Trickz
Items go home in the zip lock bag and stay in that for 24 hours. Then all rubber bands come off to be put into the washing machine with NOTHING ELSE. It just needs the quickest RINSE cycle - cold to warm water. Then left to air dry. Once washed once, can be washed with anything.

### Ingredients
* Craft
* Paper, tissue paper, pipecleaners, clay, popsicle sticks, straws
* Crayons / Textas
* Tape (ideally clear)
* Scissors
* Bicarbonate Soda x 1 15ml FLAT spoon of for every 2 children
* Red pre coloured vinegar (in jugs)

_Parties with less than 20 children_:
* 1 Tray per child
* 1 Cup per child

_Parties with 20 or more children_:
* 1 Tray shared between 2 children
* 1 Cup shared between 2 children

> Fizz Tip: Do this creation last. This creation run a little different to all other creations as it's so imaginative. Facilitators MUST engage in activating the creative process. If done wrong, this creation can be a total flop. A good starting point is -  'Who has seen Moana?! There is a beautiful Volcano in Moana, that is magical! Your challenge is to create a volcano EVEN BETTER than that one!' 

### Recipe
1. One tray and one cup between two/three children
2. Craft and textas should already be on table and start creating your volcano
> Fizz Tip: Explain what the cup is and what the tray is. Especially the younger kids, they might not know what to do, especially the visual learners - facilitators PLEASE DEMONSTRATE AND ACTUALLY MAKE WITH THE KIDS - See photos
3. Add the bicarbonate soda and finish up decorating
> Fizz Tip: Flag with any parents in the room, that the explosion is about to happen!
4. Explosion time! Kids do the explosions and facilitators WATCH and SUPPORT. Start with the Birthday child and count down from 5 - pouring in the vinegar.
> Fizz Tip: Have some paper towel close by!
5. Can do one final explosion for Birthday child

### Ingredients
* Carrageenan Powder x3 FLAT 1ml spoons
* Hot Water (not boiling) x2 15ml spoons
* Liquid Glycerin x2 15ml spoons
* Colour Dye x1 drop
* Scent (if requested) x2 shakes
* Glitter - biodegradable only (if requested)
* Popsicle Scks x1 per child
* Soap molds

> Fizz Tip: ALWAYS do this creation first in any party or holiday program

### Recipe
1. Add the carrageenan powder to bowls
2. Add the liquid glycerin to bowls and MIX (achieve no lumps)
3. Add the hot water to bowls and MIX to a thick mixture
> Fizz Tip: If it turns solid/clumps to stick - add slightly more hot water to bowl and If too liquidy - add slightly more carrageenan powder to bowl
4. Add Colour 
> Fizz Tip: Can add colour earlier if necessary (younger children)
5. Add Scent 
> Fizz Tip: Great time to play guess the scent!
6. Add glitter
7. Combine ALL mixtures into microwave safe jugs
> Fizz Tip: This can be the most boring/tricky part especially for young kids: have two jugs at the same time/multiple jugs and make teams to race to see who can finish first
8. Microwave for 60 seconds, then bring out of the microwave and mix rapidly
9. Microwave for a further 1-2 minutes until SMOOTH 
10. Pour slowly into mold with depth/height/larger mold - in front of children
> Fizz Tip: choosing molds with depth/larger ones will create a better soap
11. Place in freezer for until end of food time and remove when lining party bags up for counting to add to bags

### Fizz Tipz and Trickz
* If making galaxy wobbly soap, alternate colours between kids: one child red/pink and one child blue etc around the table and combine at the end - this will balance out colours
* If making rainbow wobbly soap, each child does a colour and combines into SEPARATE jugs. Once gone through the microwave the colours are poured separately on top of the other in the molds, waiting a few minutes between each to set. 
* Wobbly soap can be any theme or colour 
* Bluey wobbly soap, Frozen wobbly soap, Spiderman wobbly soap, Marvel wobbly soap etc

### Making Instant Snow
1. In front of the kids place a few empty creation bowls. 
2. Add 1ml of instant snow per 2 children. Ie 12 kids - one bowl add 2 spoons, another bowl add 2 spoons and the third bowl add 2 spoons (6 in total).. 
3. On the count of three add water and watch the instant snow grow!! Approx 15ml of water per 1ml spoon of snow. 
> Fizz Tip: Instant snow goes a long way, you can add more water and see if the snow expands. Once it stops expanding it doesn't need more water.

### Recipe Continued
6. Add activated snow - get all slimes flat like pancake and kids can mix snow into their purple slime - this will create the “cloud effect”
> Fizz Tip: The snow may make the slime runny and you may need to add more activator. 
7. Have fun and then place into slime containers

3. Add oil and mix, getting right to bottom
4. Add scent (if requested) and mix
5. Add colour into alternating bowls e.g. pink, blue, pink, blue, pink, blue around the table and mix
6. Each child receives one bath bomb container (not a slime container).. The process is started with their own colour and then sharing colours to layer, making a multi coloured bath bomb effect 
7. Mixture is pressed into their container as hard as they can with thumbs and heel of hands
> Fizz Tip: explain that it's like a sandcastle, the more they press down the better it will be
8. Add a unicorn horn as the final touch! 

### Fizz Tipz and Trickz
* Add more oil if too dry (bath bombs should be sticking together as though it was a cake mixture)
* More bicarb and citric if too wet - wet mixtures will not set
* Blue is a heavy colour - add less drops of blue compared to lighter colors like pink
* Purple colour can only be made with purple pigment ( tiny bit) - we do not have purple colour dye.

    name: 'Unicorn Bath Crumble',

### Ingredients
* Bath crystals x 2 FLAT 15ml spoons 
* Citric Acid x 2 FLAT 15ml spoons 
* Bicarbonate Soda X 2 FLAT 15 ml spoons 
* Pink and blue colour dye x2-4 drops depending on colour
* Scent (if requested) x2 shakes
* Containers and lids x1 per child

### Recipe
1. Add the Dry Ingredients
* First, add the bicarbonate soda to the bowls.
* Next, add the citric acid.
* Finally, add the bath crystals and mix along the way! 
2. Add Colors Assign one color per bowl: 
* One child uses pink dye, next child uses blue dye and so on around the table. 
3. Mix the Colors Each child thoroughly mixes the ingredients in their bowl to evenly distribute the color.
4. Once all colors are mixed, invite children to share bowls. Use the different colors to create layers in their clear slime container cups.
5. Lastly add the lid on the container. The Unicorn Bath Crumble is now ready to take home and enjoy!

How do they use it? Kids to sprinkle some of their crumble into their bath or hold in their hand in the shower and watch it fizz away! 

### Fizz Tipz and Trickz
* The blue is a heavy colour - 1-2 drops max. 
* Can be made without citric acid for kids with eczema.
* Mixing of colours does not work e.g., pink and blue to make purple. If purple is a colour the birthday child wants, lip pigment can be used: smaller than a pinky finger nail amount

const fairyBracelets = {
    name: 'Fairy Bracelets',
    markdown: `
### Ingredients
* Beads slit in different colours 
* Elastic 

Just like all Fizz Kidz creations, you must guide kids through the step-by-step activity as a group. 

### Instructions
**Get Creative and Build Excitement!**

Create excitement with the kids by asking questions about their designs:
“What colors do you love? “What word would you like on your bracelet? Has anyone ever made a beaded bracelet before?

1. Place all the beads in the small colored tubs on the table.
> Important: Do not pass around the plastic grid box the beads come in.
2. Hand each child a piece of pre-cut elastic.
3. Ask each child to choose one color bead to tie at the end of their elastic. This will act as the base bead.
4. **Designing the Bracelet**
* Let the kids pick and arrange their bead colors directly on the table to plan their design.
* Once they've finalized their design, they can start threading the beads onto the elastic.
* While the kids are threading their beads, one facilitator will go around the table (starting with the birthday child) and ask each child what ONE word they'd like to add to their bracelet.
5. **Tying the Bracelet**
Explain the buddy system:
* Each child works in pairs to help each other tie their bracelets.
* One child holds the bracelet securely while their partner ties it, and then they switch roles.

> Remember: Keep the energy high and ensure everyone feels included and excited about their unique creation! 🎉

    name: 'Fluid Bears',
    markdown: `
### Ingredients
* One Bear Keyring per child 
* One tray per pair of two kids 
* One slime container per child 
* Paint X all colours (also needs white)

### Process
1. Hand each child a bear Keyring. Create excitement by asking kids to name their bear! And start discussing what colours were going to paint it! 
2. As you would for Tie Dye activities, first start by standing at the front of the table and show kids what you will do. 
* Place the bear in the tray (kids share in pairs), choose colours and drip from the top of the bear allowing the paint to run down the bear. Highlight that white is important in creating a marble effect. 
3. Every child places their bear in the tray 
4. Facilitators to place paint squeezy bottles on the table
5. Help kids share the colours around. 
> FIZZ TIP: It may be easier for kids to stand up in order to squeeze the paint down the bear. 
> FIZZ TIP: You don't want to over do it as it will blend the colours too much and create a yucky colour!! _**Best to choose TWO-THREE CLOURS + WHITE..**_ 
6. Once complete, surprise the kids by asking them if they want to add GLITTER!? 
7. Lastly, hold the bear by the keyring, place it in a slime container to set. The bear should set within an hour.

export const slimeActivator = {
    name: 'Slime Activator (for all slimes)',
    markdown: `
### Instructions
1. Add _2 x 5ml spoons of Borax_ to the container.
2. Fill the container with warm water.
3. Cover the hole with your finger and shake well to mix.

**Ratio for Reference:** 1 X 5ml spoon of Borax to every 1 cup of warm water.

### Safety Precautions
Borax is a chemical that must be kept out of reach of young children and should only be used by children under supervision when making slime.\\
Borax should be stored in the back area of the studio, away from children and food.\\
Slime Activator should be made at the hand-washing sink, ensuring children are not present during preparation.\\
Always wash hands thoroughly after preparing the Slime Activator. Ensure children understand that slime is not edible when making Slime.\\
Both children and facilitators must wash their hands after playing with slime.

### Is borax safe to use?
Yes, borax is safe to use in slime when handled properly.\\
As the slime still contains chemicals, it is important to wash your hands well after playing with slime and avoid contact with your eyes and mouth.
