title: Sling Shifts and Payroll
description: Choose the right Sling shift so the payroll CSV maps work correctly in Xero.
---

The Portal converts published Sling shifts into a CSV for UpSheets and Xero. The employee, location, position, time, and notes on each shift determine the exported payroll rows.

:::note[Casual staff only]
Only casual employees are rostered in Sling. Manage other employment types outside Sling.
:::

The roster must reflect the service delivered and whether the work was hands-on or preparation. Accurate labels keep Xero labour costs split between Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for service delivery, COGS Supervisor duties, and Non COGS tasks.

:::tip[Quick rules]

- Choose a _Facilitator_ shift whenever the person is actively running the service.
- Use the service-specific _[Supervisor]_ shift for all prep, packing, shopping, calls, or other support tasks.
- Use the `[On Call]` and `[Sunday]` variants only when they match the shift.
  :::

See [Payroll](/people/payroll) for CSV generation, exception checks, and the manual UpSheets-to-Xero steps.

## How shifts map to payroll

- Only published shifts in the selected date range and business are exported.
- Sling employees are matched to Xero by email.
- The shift position maps to a Xero pay item and tracking activity; the location maps to the relevant business location.
- Sling notes are copied into the CSV for reimbursements and other review items.
- Generating the CSV does not import it or create a Xero pay run.

Do not use the Portal payroll export for Werribee. Its payroll mappings are not available.

## Core services and shifts

All seven core services have the same structure. Facilitator variants post to one COGS wage account, while Supervisor variants post to a separate Supervisor COGS wage account. Exceptions listed below post to a NON-COGS wage account.

- **Party (in studio)**
- **Mobile Party**
- **Holiday Program**
- **Events and Activations**
- **After School Program**
- **Incursions**
- **Play Lab**

## Exceptions

| Exception              | Shift names                               | When to use                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Training               | `Training`, `[Sunday] Training`           | Structured training or shadowing. Posts to Non COGS even when it happens during a program.                         |
| PIC (Person In Charge) | `PIC`, `[Sunday] PIC`                     | On-call duty manager coverage. Pays the 10% standby rate; avoid rostering it during active delivery.               |
| Miscellaneous          | `Miscellaneous`, `[Sunday] Miscellaneous` | Work that does not fit a service, such as Head Office customer service. Use sparingly and flag in Slack if unsure. |

## Rate modifiers and budgeting

Use this reference when you need a modifier on a Facilitator or Supervisor shift.

| Modifier                                            | Rate impact                                             | When to use                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <span style="white-space:nowrap">`[On Call]`</span> | Pays 10% of the base rate and does not accrue overtime. | Someone is on standby (including PIC) rather than delivering the session.         |
| <span style="white-space:nowrap">`[Sunday]`</span>  | No rate change - label supports Sling budgeting only.   | The shift falls on a Sunday; payroll still calculates penalties by calendar date. |

`Superhero` is not mapped as a Sling position by the payroll export. Any approved Superhero payment must be handled as
a manual Xero pay item rather than relying on the generated CSV.

## Laundry allowance

Payroll automatically adds a laundry allowance for staff who work eligible uniformed shifts. Managers do not need to add a separate shift or note in Sling.

### Eligible shifts

The allowance applies to hands-on facilitator shifts where staff wear the Fizz Kidz uniform, including standard, Sunday, and called-in variants for:

- Party Facilitator
- Mobile Party Facilitator
- Holiday Program Facilitator
- Events and Activations
- After School Program Facilitator
- Incursions
- Play Lab Facilitator

It does not apply to `[On Call]`, PIC, Supervisor, Training, or Miscellaneous shifts. Superhero payments are handled manually in Xero.

### Weekly cap

The export adds `$1.32` for each eligible day, capped at `$6.62` per employee per week. Multiple eligible shifts on one day receive one allowance for that day.

## Overtime thresholds in Sling

Sling flags overtime once someone hits 38 hours in a single week. Use the warning as a cue to redistribute hours so most staff stay below the limit.

Remember that `[On Call]` shifts do not count toward overtime in payroll but **do** count toward the Sling warning. If a roster is heavy on `[On Call]` coverage you may safely run over 38 rostered hours, but call it out for Finance so the discrepancy is understood.
