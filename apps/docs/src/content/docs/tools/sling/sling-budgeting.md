title: Budgeting in Sling
description: Understand how Sling estimates roster costs.
---

Sling budgeting estimates labour cost from the roster. It is a planning figure, not a payroll result. The estimate uses the wage assigned to each employee-position combination and the loading represented by labels such as `[On Call]`, `[Superhero]`, and `[Sunday]`.

## How wage data stays current

- Wages sync from Xero every Friday at 6:00 a.m., immediately after the Thursday payroll run.
- Casual employees with synced Xero wage data are assigned an estimate for every Sling position.
- Employees are matched between Sling and the correct Xero organisation by email and location.

## Budget and payroll differences

Sling is a roster estimate, while the Portal and Xero calculate payroll.

- New starters receive a Sling wage estimate in the Friday sync after their first payroll.
- Birthday rate changes appear after the next Friday sync.
- Travel allowances, laundry allowances, and other extras are added in Xero payroll only - they never appear in Sling’s budgeting view.
- Sling does not calculate overtime penalties.

The final calculation happens when the Portal generates the [payroll CSV](/people/payroll), and then again when the file is reviewed and imported into Xero.

## Overtime thresholds in Sling

Sling flags overtime once someone hits 38 hours in a single week. Use the warning as a cue to redistribute hours so most staff stay below the limit.

Remember that `[On Call]` shifts do not count toward overtime in payroll but **do** count toward the Sling warning. If a roster is heavy on `[On Call]` coverage you may safely run over 38 rostered hours, but call it out for Finance so the discrepancy is understood.
