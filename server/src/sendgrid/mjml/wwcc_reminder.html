    This email is a reminder that the following employees provided their WWCC application number, however we do not yet
    have a copy of their actual WWCC:

    <ul>
        {{#employees}}
        <li>{{.}}</li>
        {{/employees}}
    </ul>

    If an employee on this list has provided their WWCC, be sure to upload it to their folder on Google Drive, and then
    go to the 'Onboarding' page on the Fizz Kidz Portal and mark them as having provided it. This will remove them from
    this reminder.
