    After filling out a party details form, a matching booking could not be found in our system. As a result, the party sheet was not generated.
    <p>In order to fix this problem, find the booking sheet, and ensure the details match what is shown below</p>
    <p><b>Parent Name: </b><?= parentName ?></p>
    <p><b>Child Name and Age: </b><?= childName ?>, <?= childAge ?></p>
    <p><b>Location: </b><?= location ?></p>
    <p><b>Date and Time of Party: </b><?= dateTime ?></p>
    <p>Once the booking sheet has been updated, fill in the form again using the answers from the Party Details (Responses) spreadsheet</p>
    <p><b>NOTE: </b>Be sure to enter the time as 24 hour in the form. (ie 2pm = 14:00)</p>
    <p>:)</p>
