  <p><strong class="tieDye">Note about Tie Dye</strong><br />We use high quality, non-toxic tie dye. As the dye is of a
    high quality your kids will make amazing Tie Dye items during their upcoming party! That said, it will also
    unfortunately stain whatever material it lands on. While the kids will be wearing smocks and gloves, accidents can
    happen and we suggest kids wear clothes they won't mind accidentally staining.</p>
